# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## Problem

This project presents my solution to the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster."

On April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic tragically sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This disaster shocked the world and led to significant improvements in maritime safety regulations.

The project leverages machine learning techniques to predict which passengers were likely to survive the tragedy. Factors such as gender, age, social class, and other relevant attributes are considered in the analysis.

## Description

- `train.csv` - Contains the training data.
- `test.csv` - Contains the testing data for making predictions.

## Performance

The method described in the Project Description yielded satisfactory results, achieving a score of 0.78708.

*Note: Rankings may change as the competition is still ongoing.*
